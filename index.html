			<h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
			<p>League of Legends (LoL) is a highly popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) 
			   video game developed and published by Riot Games. It was first released in October 2009. 
			   The game is free-to-play and supported by microtransactions.
			</p>

			<p>
			   In League of Legends, players assume the role of "champions," each with their own unique 
			   abilities and playstyles. The game is played in matches where two teams of five players, known as "champions," 
			   compete against each other with the ultimate goal of destroying the opposing team's Nexus, which is the core 
			   building located within their base.

				<img src="runtera-league.png" alt="Map of the world" width="300" height="200">
				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>The game is set in the fictional world of Runeterra and incorporates elements of fantasy and magic. Runeterra 
				   is a diverse world composed of distinct regions, each with its unique cultures and landscapes. Demacia
				   known for justice and order, contrasts with Noxus, an expansionist empire valuing strength. Piltover and Zaun 
				   coexist as twin cities, Piltover thriving on technology and progress, while Zaun is industrial and chaotic. Ionia 
				   values harmony between magic and nature, Freljord struggles for dominance in its frozen tundra, and the Shadow Isles 
				   re haunted and cursed. Bilgewater is a haven for pirates in a bustling port city, and Mount Targon, a mystical mountain, 
				   is home to celestial beings. The lore continually evolves through events, champion releases, and various media, creating a 
				   rich and dynamic world for players to explore.

			<h2>Runterras Creation</h2>
			<img src="aurelion sol-league.gif" alt="Aurelion Sol" width="300" height="200">
				<p>In the mystical tapestry of the League of Legends universe, the creation of Runeterra is a tale woven with celestial threads 
				   and cosmic forces. At the heart of this genesis stands Aurelion Sol, a majestic celestial dragon whose radiant breath forged 
				   the stars. Enslaved by mortal hands from Targon, he was bound to the Celestial Forge a magnificent contraption that allowed the 
				   Targonians to shape the very fabric of reality. The World Runes, powerful artifacts of immense consequence, played a pivotal role 
				   in this shaping, as the Targonians sought dominion over the celestial powers. However, conflicts among the celestial beings ensued, 
				   leading to the transformation of Atreus into the celestial warrior Pantheon. Runeterra's diverse realms, including the Freljord, Demacia, 
				   and Noxus, emerged as manifestations of these celestial manipulations. Magic, an ever-present force, courses through the land, defining 
				   the unique characteristics of each region. Yet, the dark and insidious Void, a malevolent counterpart to celestial magic, seeks to consume 
				   all. The Darkin, once Ascended beings touched by celestial power, were corrupted by the Void, embodying the ongoing struggle between creation 
				   and destruction in the vast and enchanting world of Runeterra.
